## Quantification Pipeline of Nuclear Localized Fluorescent Cells in Tissue 
This pipeline can be used to perform analysis and quantification on images of whole tissue to determine how many fluoresenct cells are present. The median brightness of those cells can subsequently be determined. 

## Motivation
Many biologists too frequently rely on manual quantification for image analysis, limiting the size of tissue that can be examined and biasing the results to the regions examined. Quantification pipelines have been built to provide researchers flexibility, but these frequently overemphasize intensity thresholding to determine cells and have poor methods to adjust their techniques when background intensity varies wildly over an image.
Simple strategies are applied here to enable whole tissue analysis to expand the biologist's toolkit for tissue quantification.
